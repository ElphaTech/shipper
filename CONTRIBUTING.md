# Contributing to shipper
While I originally expected to work on this as a personal project and did not expect any help, I have been proven incorrect and am very grateful of such. Please see below on how you can help.

# How to contribute
1) Just use shipper to see how it works.
2) Make issues with feature requests or bug reports.
3) Volunteer to fix an issue.

# Notes
- Please attempt to make your issues and pull requests somewhat descriptive.
- If you decide on helping modify the TUI, install textual-dev using pip and see the [devtools guide](https://textual.textualize.io/guide/devtools/).
